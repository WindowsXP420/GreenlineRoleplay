# 2.8 Disciplinary Process

The disciplinary procedure of the Los Santos Police Department falls into three categories of reprimand, being field correction, Moderate Infraction and board review. Field correction is the low-level discipline of minor infractions against punitive articles. At this level, immediate action is taken by supervisors or watch commanders to correct improper conduct. Moderate Infraction is typically reserved for more serious but common breaches of regulation, in which administrative action is taken against a Officer by their commander (and unit supervisor at the discretion of the commander). Finally, board review is reserved for the most serious of cases where an Officer has acted in an intentionally malicious way with potentially direct results. Board reviews are conducted by Los Santo Police Department Administration and will often by not always include the relevant division commanders. The scope of intervention for each category is detailed below.
