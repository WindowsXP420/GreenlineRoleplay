# 5.14 - Warrants

The issuance of warrants (arrest warrants, search warrants, etc.) is only to be conducted by supervisors or a Detective as the result of an investigation. Said supervisor shall request to be fully briefed on the circumstances of the warrant and the evidence to support the warrant **BEFORE** the warrant is issued. Every warrant will include a brief description of the circumstances that justify the issuance of the warrant. In the event that the warrant is issued as a result of an investigation that requires questioning of the suspect (such as those issued by the Court), the warrant shall be titled as “Investigational” and shall only be served while that investigator (or a Detective fully briefed on the case) is online and available to handle the investigation. Should the circumstances regarding an investigational warrant be unknown, that warrant shall be nullified and removed from said suspect’s record. Shall a Supervisor be unavailable a warrant may be carried through, however supervisorial consultation is highly recommended.
