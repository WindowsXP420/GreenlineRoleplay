# 5.16 - Citations and Charges

Citations and charges are to be issued/filled in accordance with the laws and ordinances of the State of San Andreas. At no time shall a citation be issued, nor a charge filled is not specifically issued within these laws/ordinances. When issuing a citation, the following procedure is to be followed:

1. The violation is identified by the Officer
2. Suspect provides the Officer with positive identification.
3. Officer writes the citation.
4. Officer explains the citation to the suspect, detailing the reason for the citation, the date of appearance, that signing only indicates notification of the infraction and the suspects agreement to appear in court.
5. The suspect signs the citation.
6. The server command is executed to issue the citation.
7. The suspect is given their copy of the citation and permitted to leave (if they are permitted) Should a suspect either refuse to identify themselves or refuse to sign the citation, they shall be informed that refusal to do so is a misdemeanor crime that will result in their arrest. Should they still refuse to sign the citation, they shall be arrested for either “failure to identify” and held until such a time they either identify themselves (in the case of the former) or sign the citation (in the case of the latter).
