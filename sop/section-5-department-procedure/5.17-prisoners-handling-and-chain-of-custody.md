# 5.17 - Prisoners - Handling and Chain of Custody

While a prisoner is under the custody of a Los Santos Police Officer, the wellbeing of that prisoner becomes the responsibility of that Officer. The Officer shall not respond to any callouts and shall prioritize handing that prisoner off to the appropriate authority. At any stage a prisoner is transferred, the complete list of charges placed against that prisoner shall be communicated to the entity to whom custody is being transferred along with any medical conditions or requirements that prisoner may have. At no stage is a prisoner to be left unattended in a place an Officer cannot see or reasonably move to see that prisoner or the prisoner could have proper means to escape.
