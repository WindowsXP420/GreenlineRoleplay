# 5.18 - Evidence - Handling and Chain of Custody

The correct handling of evidence is paramount to the prosecution of criminal cases. As such, all evidence is to be handled carefully and in a manner through which to negate any possible contamination or misplacement. All evidence of a scene is the responsibility of each Officer on the scene. At no stage, shall evidence be unnecessarily moved or altered. All evidence shall be appropriately contained (in standard issue evidence bags, containers, etc.) and appropriately logged at the scene by the Officer in charge. At no stage should evidence be left unattended once collected (such left in the back of an empty car or outside of the transport vehicle).
