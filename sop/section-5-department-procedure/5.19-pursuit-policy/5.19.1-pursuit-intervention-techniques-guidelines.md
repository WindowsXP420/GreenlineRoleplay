# 5.19.1 - Pursuit Intervention Techniques Guidelines

**Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the safe and effective use of Pursuit Intervention Techniques (PIT) by agency personnel during vehicle pursuits. This policy emphasizes immediate safety considerations and authorizes the use of PIT when conditions permit, without requiring waiting periods or arbitrary time delays.

#### **Policy Statement**

It is the policy of this agency to prioritize public safety, officer safety, and the safe resolution of vehicle pursuits. Officers are authorized to use PIT to terminate vehicle pursuits when it is deemed necessary and safe, consistent with training, applicable laws, and this policy.

***

**Guidelines**

**1. Authorization to use PIT**

Troopers may use the PIT maneuver to terminate a vehicle pursuit when:

* The fleeing suspect poses an ongoing threat to public safety or trooper safety.
* Other methods to terminate the pursuit (e.g., stop sticks) are not feasible or practical.
* The trooper determines that the use of PIT can be conducted safely based on environmental and situational factors.

**2. Situational Considerations**

Before initiating a PIT maneuver, troopers must assess:

* **Roadway Conditions:** Evaluate traffic density, weather, road surface, and proximity to intersections or obstacles.
* **Vehicle and Occupant Safety:** Consider the size, weight, and type of both the fleeing vehicle and the patrol vehicle. Avoid using PIT on motorcycles or other vehicles where PIT would be ineffective or unsafe.
* **Proximity to Pedestrians or Bystanders:** Ensure there is minimal risk to uninvolved individuals.
* **Timing of PIT:** Troopers are not required to wait for specific time durations (e.g., PIT timers) to deploy the maneuver if the conditions for safe execution are met.

**3. Post-Maneuver Responsibilities**

After the successful use of a PIT maneuver:

* Troopers must ensure the scene is secure and provide medical assistance to any injured individuals.
* All involved troopers must complete required incident and use-of-force reports detailing the circumstances and justification for the PIT maneuvers

***

#### **Accountability and Review**

1. **Incident Review:** All uses of PIT will be reviewed by the San Andreas State Policeâ€™s chain of command to ensure compliance with policy.
2. **Continuous Improvement:** The San Andreas State Police will periodically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PIT maneuvers based on incident reviews, training advancements, and evolving best practices.

***

#### **Restrictions**

The following restrictions apply to the use of PIT:

* PIT should not be used if it is determined that the risks of the maneuver outweigh the benefits of terminating the pursuit.
* Troopers must not attempt PIT at speeds exceeding training limits unless exigent circumstances exist.
* <mark style="color:red;">PIT must not be used on vehicles with high passenger loads (e.g., buses)</mark> or vehicles transporting hazardous materials.
* PIT can be used on vehicles with high passenger loads (e.g., buses) if the vehicles has no passengers or all passengers on board have or violated a crime code (example: Bus used to rob bank and all passengers are robbers)

***

#### **Conclusion**

The safe and effective resolution of vehicle pursuits is critical to public and trooper safety. This policy ensures officers are empowered to use PIT when necessary and safe, without unnecessary delays, and within the bounds of their training and discretion.
