# 5.20 - Felony Stops

Felony, or High-Risk, stops shall only be performed on stopped vehicles when Officers have reason to believe that one or more of the occupants of the vehicle has the potential to impose injury or death upon Officer or civilians. High-Risk Stops should be conducted with the utmost caution and regard for public safety and Officer safety. In the event of a felony stop being initiated, the Officer initiating the stop shall first call for an appropriate amount of additional units, and then initiate the felony stop when those units arrive. Once all required units are on scene, in their correct positions and have indicated they are ready to perform the stop, the primary Officer shall give clear, concise and simple commands to remove each occupant of the vehicle in turn and direct them to the Officer. Once it is believed that the vehicle is clear and all occupants have been searched, detained and seated, Officers shall than clear the vehicle of any hidden occupants. The deployment of patrol rifles and shotguns during a felony stop is encouraged for all but the Officer handling the detainment of the vehicle's occupants.
