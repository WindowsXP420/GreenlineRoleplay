## Marked Vehicle Policy

All marked vehicles must have a mounted lightbar on the roof and comply with all requirements set by the marked. All marked vehicles must display a clear and visible San Andreas State Police Department of Public Safety (DPS) logo prominently on the side of the vehicle. This is to ensure easy identification and enhance the security presence in the community. The design specifications mandate that the vehicle should predominantly feature a sleek black body, providing a professional and authoritative appearance, which is effective in various operational scenarios. Complementing this, the vehicle should have a contrasting white hood. This distinctive styling aids in the rapid recognition of law enforcement vehicles by both the public and other officers, thereby fostering a sense of safety and vigilance. Additionally, the blend of black and white not only aligns with traditional law enforcement color schemes but also ensures maximum visibility in a range of environmental conditions and lighting scenarios. This uniformity in appearance contributes to the cohesive image of the San Andreas State Police fleet.

## Slicktop Vehicle Policy

All slicktop vehicles must have a visor lights or dash light mount in the front windshield. All slicktops vehicles must display a clear and visible San Andreas State Police Department of Public Safety (DPS) logo prominently on the side of the vehicle. This is to ensure easy identification and enhance the security presence in the community. The design specifications mandate that the vehicle should predominantly feature a sleek black body, providing a professional and authoritative appearance, which is effective in various operational scenarios.

## Ghosted Vehicle Policy

Ghosted vehicles serve a crucial role within the San Andreas State Police fleet by blending covert operations with a subtle law enforcement presence. Adhering to the following comprehensive guidelines ensures these vehicles are effectively integrated into our operational capabilities while maintaining safety and functionality:

1. **Exterior Design and Markings:**
   * Ghosted vehicles must use subdued, low-contrast decals. The DPS logo and any departmental insignias should be faintly visible to ensure the vehicle maintains a less conspicuous profile while still being identifiable as law enforcement upon close inspection.
   * The vehicles should be predominantly black with a satin or matte finish, reducing reflections and enhancing their stealth appearance. This finish helps prevent unnecessary attention during both day and night operations.
   * Any markings applied should utilize reflective materials that only become highly visible when illuminated by direct light, contributing to the subtle yet practical design of the ghosted vehicle.

## Unmarked Vehicle Policy

For all unmarked vehicles in active service, adhering to the following guidelines is crucial:

1. **Color Specifications:**
   * All unmarked vehicles must possess a factory-issued color.
   * This includes special color options provided by the manufacturer, such as the popular Dodge Green. These distinctive colors contribute to the vehicle's capacity to blend in while maintaining a professional appearance.
2. **Logo and Decal Guidelines:**
   * It is imperative that all unmarked vehicles do not have any visible SASP (San Andreas State Police) logos. This ensures the vehicles maintain their anonymity.
   * Unmarked vehicles are to maintain a clean and professional look without any visible police insignia that could compromise their covert status.
3. **Lighting Equipment:**
   * No visible lightbars are permitted on the roofs of these vehicles.
   * Instead, discrete emergency lighting systems should be utilized, ensuring that the vehicles can operate efficiently in various conditions while maintaining an unmarked status.
4. **License Plate Regulations:**
   * Vehicles are authorized to display plates such as "SA01KSP01," ensuring they're consistent with operational standards.
   * Alternatively, plates containing a format incorporating the callsign of "K-##" are permissible. This assists in easy identification by authorized personnel while still preserving the intended anonymity.

By following these comprehensive guidelines, unmarked vehicles can effectively serve their purpose while adhering to department protocols for safety
