## Marked Vehicle Policy

All marked vehicles must have a mounted lightbar on the roof and comply with all requirements set by the marked. All marked vehicles must display a clear and visible San Andreas State Police Department of Public Safety (DPS) logo prominently on the side of the vehicle. This is to ensure easy identification and enhance the security presence in the community. The design specifications mandate that the vehicle should predominantly feature a sleek black body, providing a professional and authoritative appearance, which is effective in various operational scenarios. Complementing this, the vehicle should have a contrasting white hood. This distinctive styling aids in the rapid recognition of law enforcement vehicles by both the public and other officers, thereby fostering a sense of safety and vigilance. Additionally, the blend of black and white not only aligns with traditional law enforcement color schemes but also ensures maximum visibility in a range of environmental conditions and lighting scenarios. This uniformity in appearance contributes to the cohesive image of the San Andreas State Police fleet.
