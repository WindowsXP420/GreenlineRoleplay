# 5.4 - Call Response

In the event of an emergency call (defined later in this section), any unit may choose to respond to the call. Additional responding units may be called off by the first Officer on scene should they determine that either the emergency situation has been resolved or that no additional units would benefit the situation.

In the event that an Officer calls for “additional(s)”, the first unit to accept the call may respond code 2 (priority, lights without sirens) to the location of the Officer. Should the Officer calling for additional(s) stipulate that they require more than one unit in their call, additional Officer may respond until the required number of Officer is met.

In the event that an Officer calls for “assistance”, the first three units to respond may respond Code 3 (lights and sirens) to assist the Officer already on scene. In the event that an insufficient number of units respond to the call for assistance, Officer already on a routine call or traffic stops are required to drop their call to respond to the Officer in need of assistance until the required number of responding units is met or the Officer on scene or Officer in charge (OIC) of that scene determines that the completed response is adequate for the situation. In the event that an Officer calls for “backup” all units that are not already engaged on an emergency call are required to drop their active call, traffic stop or other duty and responding code 3 to the location of that Officer. Should the Officer who called for backup or the Officer in charge of that situation deem that the completed response is adequate for the situation, they may call off any units still responding.
