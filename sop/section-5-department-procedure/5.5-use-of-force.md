# 5.5 - Use of Force

Officer are required to obey the force elevation continuum at all times. This continuum exists to best prevent injury to the Troopers and civilians while still ensuring that suspects are not subjected to any unnecessary or potentially lethal force when not warranted.

The force elevation continuum is as follows:

1. Should a suspect be compliant, non-combative and not pose a risk to the health or well-being of an Officer or civilians, no​ ​use​ ​of​ ​force​ ​is​ ​required​.
2. Should a suspect be non-compliant, non-combative and not pose a risk to the health or wellbeing of an Officers or civilians, strong​ ​grip​ ​and​ ​guiding​ ​movements​ ​are permitted​.
3. Should a suspect be non-compliant, combative, unarmed and utilizing strikes or kicks against an Officer without a real and imminent risk of serious injury or death, the deployment​ ​of​ ​less-than​ ​lethal​ ​equipment​ ​such​ ​as​ ​tasers,​ ​batons​ ​and​ ​OC​ ​spray​ ​is permitted​.
4. Should a suspect be non-compliant, non-combative, armed with a non-ranged weapon or implement and a pose a potential risk of serious injury or death, deployment of less-then lethal equipment such as tasers along with lethal force&#x20;
5. Should a suspect be non-compliant, combative, armed with a melee or ranged weapon or firearm, or unarmed and are actively engaging an Officer or civilian AND pose an immediate risk of serious injury or death, ​ ​use​ ​of​ ​lethal​ ​force​ ​is​ ​permitted​.
6. Should a suspect be non-compliant and evade on foot, using a vehicle to ram the suspect is not permitted, unless the suspect actively poses a risk of serious injury or death towards the general public/Officer.

At all times the Use-of-Force should be reasonable and meet use of force guidelines\
