# 8.2 - Reduce of activity

Should an Trooper be unable to participate in San Andreas State Police activities and patrols or unable to fulfill hour requirements, they shall post a notification of absence in the appropriate section of the forums. In the event that unforeseen circumstances prevent the lodging of a notice of absence, any removal from the SASP shall be reverted and the Trooper reinstated at their previous rank and grade (subject to positional availability).
