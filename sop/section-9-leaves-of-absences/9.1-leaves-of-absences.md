# 8.1 - Leaves of Absences

Should an Trooper be unable to participate in San Andreas State Police activities and patrols for a period greater than Seven days or otherwise be absent, they shall post a notification of absence in the appropriate section of the forums. In the event that unforeseen circumstances prevent the lodging of a notice of absence, any removal from the SASP shall be reverted and the Trooper reinstated at their previous rank and grade (subject to positional availability).

If an Trooper wishes to take a leave of absence that is longer than a period of two months, the Trooper shall contact Department Administration.
