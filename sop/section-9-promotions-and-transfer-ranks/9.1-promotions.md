# 9.1 - Promotions

## Promotion Cycle Date:

The San Andreas State Police has made a decision regarding the promotion dates for all active troopers who have fulfilled the necessary criteria as specified in their guidelines. Promotions will be conducted either on the last Sunday or the last Monday of the month, ensuring that those troopers who have met the stated requirements are recognized in a timely manner. This approach is designed to uniformly and fairly provide career advancement opportunities, acknowledging the dedication and commitment of eligible troopers within the force. Additionally, this method offers flexibility in scheduling, accommodating both departmental needs and trooper availability.

## How promotions work

All promotions done within the San Andreas State Police are done by vote of supervisor+ and are decided on by performance, activity, requirements, and by punishments taken against the troopers.&#x20;
