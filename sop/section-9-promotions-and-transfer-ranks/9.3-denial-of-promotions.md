# 9.3 - Denial of Promotions

Denial of promotions within the San Andreas State Police is determined through a vote conducted by supervisory troopers. This decision-making process takes into account various factors including:

* **Activity**: The level of involvement and performance of troopers within their duties and responsibilities in the San Andreas State Police is a key consideration.
* **Promotion Requirements**: Troopers must meet specific criteria established for advancement, which may include tests, training, and service years.
* **Disciplinary Actions**: Any punishments or disciplinary measures taken against troopers may influence their eligibility and likelihood of receiving a promotion.
* **New Transfers**: Troopers who have transferred into the San Andreas State Police after the initiation of the promotion cycle may also impact the decision, depending on their experience and qualifications.

These elements are critically evaluated to ensure that only the most deserving and qualified troopers receive promotions, maintaining the standards and integrity of the force..&#x20;
