# Confidential Informants

**Definitions**

_**Confidential Informant (CI)**_: A person who provides information to a department investigator on a continuing or regular basis and wishes their identity to remain confidential.

This does not include "concerned citizens" who provide information on an informal or casual basis.

**Special Circumstances**

Certain persons should not be used as informants, except in special circumstances with the approval of the Unit Commander. Such persons include: Juveniles (a child who has not yet attained their seventeenth (17) birthday), without parental or guardian approval; Persons wanted on warrants; Persons with a criminal record for perjury; or Persons with a history of serious mental disorder or defect.

Precautions shall be taken to protect the reputations and safety of informants and investigators. Some informants may require additional precautions:

* Addicts- should be carefully supervised and controlled
* Parolees- should be avoided whenever possible. Parolees are prohibited from associating with felons and approval from the informant's parole officer is required.

Registration of Informants

When a person indicates a willingness to cooperate and provide information, the Unit Commander or designee shall:

* Interview the person as soon as practical
* Investigate the background and suitability of the potential informant
* Forward the name and biographical data to the appropriate Detective Captain for entry into the Confidential Informant Database.

**The Detective Captain shall:**

* Check the CI’s name against the Undesirable Informant List
* Notify the **** Commander if the CI is currently cooperating and/or assigned to another section/unit.

If the person is approved to be a CI, the appropriate investigator shall:

* Interview the Informant and File and Informant Information Report&#x20;
* Debrief the CI regarding their knowledge of other crimes.

**Protecting Informant’s Identity**

The law recognizes the government’s privilege not to reveal the identity of a confidential informant. Protecting the identity of all informants from disclosure is an important factor for two reasons:

1. The informant’s safety from retaliation on part of the criminals they helped implicate
2. Disclosure of their identity would prevent the informant from assisting on future investigations

However, the privilege is not absolute, and should be respected as far as reasonably possible consistent with fairness to a defendant.

**Informant Management**

units using informants shall maintain a file for each CI, in a locked and secure location accessible only to the Unit Commander or designee. This file shall include:

* Code Name and Code Number designations
* Biographical and background information
* Criminal history records
* Other information deemed necessary by the **** Commander

**Commanders shall:**

* Periodically review and evaluate all informants work performance, usefulness, reliability, desirability and records of payment
* Meet on a semi-annual basis with all registered informants, both confidential and named, and their controlling officers
* Submit a determination of the status of the informant in writing to the Division of Investigative Services
* Submit in writing to the Commander the reasons, if any, when an informant is closed out.

**Undesirable Informants**

The primary handler shall submit a report detailing the CI’s undesirable conduct to their Unit Commander whenever a CI:

* Endangers officer’s safety
* Deliberately gives false or misleading information
* Is otherwise determined to be undesirable for use as an informant.

The Detective Captain shall submit to the Commander:

* Documentation when a CI is terminated for being undesirable
* A copy of the primary handler's report.

The Commander shall:

* Place the CI on the Undesirable Informant List maintained by the DIS.

**Promises to Informants**

Members may:

* Inform the District Attorney or other agencies of the information provided by the CI and the investigation results
* Make recommendations to a District Attorney’s Office, probation officer, or other criminal justice agency for a disposition on behalf of the CI
* Not make any promises to a CI concerning the outcome of a pending court case.

**Note:** The disposition of court cases is in the province of the District Attorney’s Office and the Judiciary.

**Precautions**

Interactions with CIs should be kept to the minimum necessary for effective investigation purposes. Whenever possible and practical, meetings with CIs shall be:&#x20;

Attended by two (2) members, and with prior notification of the **** Commander or a supervisor, or as soon as practical after the meet.

A member who interacts with an known informant, when not on duty or not during the course of an investigation shall:

* Notify their supervisor as soon as practical
* Document the reason for such interaction in the CI's file

Whenever practical, a CI should not report to the Unit's office in order to protect their identity and the identity of other undercover members. CIs shall not:&#x20;

Be introduced to more than a minimum number of undercover members, to ensure that informants gain as little information as possible concerning undercover operations and unit activity.

Any member who uncovers information that an informant has engaged in unauthorized criminal activity shall immediately notify their Unit Commander or designee.

The Commander or designee shall:&#x20;

* Conduct an immediate evaluation of the information and take such action as they deem necessary
* Make every effort to prosecute the CI involved in any unauthorized criminal activity.

**Search Warrants**

Search warrant applications and their accompanying affidavits containing information from a CI, shall be reviewed and approved by a supervisor before filing the application with the court of jurisdiction.

**Field Services**

Members assigned to Field Services who are seeking to use an individual as a CI shall advise their Shift Commander. The Shift Commander shall:&#x20;

* Contact their **** Commander through channels for authorization to manage and register the CI
