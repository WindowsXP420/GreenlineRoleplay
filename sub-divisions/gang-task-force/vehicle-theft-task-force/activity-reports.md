# Activity Reports

## Activity reports are necessary so that all members of the chain of command are kept continuously abreast of the operation of subordinate elements. The procedures which follow have been developed to facilitate the accomplishment of this task. These procedures are not intended to replace the day to day communication which must exist between subordinates and supervisors at all levels of the chain of command.&#x20;

## I. Daily Activity Report - all supervisors of the G.N.T.F shall complete a report, on a daily basis, which will contain the following information:&#x20;

1\) A brief statement of the investigators' activities for the assigned investigation&#x20;

2\) All Supervisors of the Narcotics Unit shall complete a daily activity report.&#x20;

B. The daily report shall contain a description of all seized narcotics, weights and values, arrests, and other activities, with specific reference to G.N.T.F case numbers and Departmental case numbers (if applicable). This will create a database for statistical information requested by various segments of the community.&#x20;

C. This report shall be due no later than the same day as the seize was held.
