## I. General Responsibilities&#x20;

A. Cellular telephones are a privilege, not a right, issued and/or recalled at the discretion of the chief.&#x20;

B. Cellular telephones will be utilized only when necessary. Radios are still the primary method of communication.&#x20;

C. Cellular telephones will be maintained during all undercover operations and surveillances. Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, e.g., surveillance team.&#x20;

E. Cellular telephone numbers will only be given out for job related reasons and otherwise kept confidential.&#x20;
